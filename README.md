This repo serves as a template for a minimal set of tools used in creating one-page websites.

### The tools

- [sergey](https://sergey.cool/): a truly minimal static site generator only used to break down html into small reusable components (partials)
- [UI kit](https://getuikit.com/): a lightweight and modular front-end framework
- Scss: auto compiled to css using VS Code plugin [Live Sass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) or your compiler of choice
